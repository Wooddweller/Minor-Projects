    "Question 1: Compact List Data Structure\n",
    "In this task, you have to implement a data structure called a compact list. Compact lists\n",
    "are compact ways of representing large sets of integers, where the set contains long runs of\n",
    "consecutive integers. For example, the set of integers\n",
    "{−1000, −999, −998, . . . , −10} ∪ {100, 101, 102, . . . , 200} ∪ {1001, 1002, 1003, . . . , 1999}\n",
    "is represented by the compact list ⟨−1000, −9, 100, 201, 1001, 2000⟩. The meaning of this list is\n",
    "that the numbers start at −1000, then the first number that is not in the list is −9, then the\n",
    "first number after −9 that is again in the set is 100, then the first number after 100 that is not\n",
    "in the set is 201, then the first number after 201 that is in the set is 1001, and the first number\n",
    "after 1001 that is not in the set is 2000. Since the list ends here, no number from 2000 and\n",
    "onwards is in the set.\n",
    "As another example, the set {−5, −4, −3, 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10} is represented by the compact list\n",
    "⟨−5, −2, 0, 3, 7, 11⟩.\n",
    "Compact lists can also have an odd length. For example, the compact list ⟨5, 70, 80⟩ represents the set {5, 6, 7, . . . , 69, 80, . . . }. Thus, we understand a compact list of odd length as\n",
    "representing a set which after a certain value (in this case 80) contains all integers from that\n",
    "value on. In practice, such as when we implement compact lists for integers, we let the set go\n",
    "up to a maximum value, which will fix as a variable MAX. We also set MIN as the minimum value\n",
    "of an integer included in a set. In other words, the sets that we represent as compact lists will\n",
    "be subsets of the universal set {MIN, MIN+1,. . . ,MAX}.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a compact list of integers represents a set of integers as a list ⟨x0, x1, x2, . . .⟩ of\n",
    "integers such that x0 < x1 < x2 < . . . , with the meaning that all integers from x0 to x1 − 1,\n",
    "as well as all from x2 to x3 − 1, and so on, are included in the set. Thus, the included integers\n",
    "start at x0, then the first integer larger than x0 not to be included is x1, then the next integer\n",
    "after x1 to be included is x2 and so on. The empty set is represented as an empty list (of length\n",
    "0). If the compact list has an odd length, it contains all values from the last entry in the list\n",
    "up to the maximum value MAX. As a final example, the set of all integers is represented by the\n",
    "one-element compact list ⟨MIN⟩: that is, it consists of the single number MIN.\n",
    "You have to implement a class called CompactList which implements various set operations,\n",
    "as described below. Before we describe the various functionalities, we quickly review the basic\n",
    "set operations and relations, to establish notation. Given sets A and B,\n",
    " their union is the set A ∪ B defined as the set of all elements that are in A or in B or in\n",
    "both A and B,\n",
    " their intersection is the set A ∩ B defined as the set of all elements that are in A and in\n",
    "B,\n",
    " their difference is the set A \\ B defined as the set of all elements that are in A but not in\n",
    "B.\n",
    "The set A is a subset of set B, written A ⊆ B, if each element of A is also an element of B. The\n",
    "sets A and B are considered to be equal if they have the same elements.\n",
    "If all the sets that we consider are contained in some universal set U, then the complement\n",
    "of set A is the set Ac = U \\ A. Below, whenever we mention union, intersection, difference or\n",
    "complement, we always refer to the sets represented by compact lists of integers. For example,\n",
    "the union of the set A = {10, . . . , 19} represented by the compact list ⟨10, 20⟩, and the set\n",
    "B = {30, . . . , 39} represented by the compact list ⟨30, 40⟩, is the set A ∪ B represented by the\n",
    "compact list ⟨10, 20, 30, 40⟩. As another example, the intersection of the set A with the set\n",
    "C = {15, . . . , 24}, represented by the compact list ⟨15, 25⟩, is the set A ∩ C = {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}\n",
    "represented by the compact list ⟨15, 20⟩.\n",
    "For the purposes of our set operations, the universal set is the set {MIN,MIN+1,. . . ,MAX} of\n",
    "integers, and so we take complements with respect to this set. For example, the complement of\n",
    "set A is the set {MIN, . . . , 9} ∪ {20, . . . }, represented by the compact list ⟨MIN, 10, 20⟩.\n",
